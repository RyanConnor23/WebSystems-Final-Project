    1. Breakdown

    - My client is my dad, this will be a professional website for him to use as a way to display his career
    achievements and work he has done throughout his career

    - My website's header is included in the navbar, which is a smaller version of my client's headshot with the 
    name of the website.

    - My sight has enough pages to display all his work, and if he had more projects he wants to add. Then it is
    as simple adding more cards to the portfolio page and creating a page for that project. I think I have enough
    pages to not become redundant.

    - Navigation bar that moves with scrolling to go from home page, to portolfio pages / project pages, and back
    to home page

    - All my webpages should have styling to allow for large and smaller screen, as well as styling to allow users
    to shrint and expand the page and have the layout still look good.

    - Global styling and rules are located in the css file, and all the pages are using that style sheet to keep the
    same look throughout the website.

    - Images are scattered throughout the pages, representing projects, a head shot of my client, as well as alt
    text to describe the image if the images are disabled / not working correctly.
    
    - Each sight does declare its favicon, which is located in the images folder.

    - All non html resources are located in properly labeled folders with the correct names.

    - I did not use any frameworks to develop this website, so no Bootstrap, React, Angular, etc.

    - All file names are in lowercase and only contain alphanumeric characters.

    - I believe my site to be neatly aligned, and everything fits and flows very nice to have a great user experience.

    - My site does have two different font faces, one is a font that is imported from google and is located in the 
    index.css file, and the other is also a font imported from google located in the same place. 

    - My site does not include four seperate webpages with forms. However, my form does allow for four different
    inputs of information. I honestly couldn't think of four different forms I could create for a professional 
    website that would be useful / not repetetive.

    - My client expressed great emphasis on being able to go to external sites for more information. In this case, 
    it is Linked in, facebook, github, and email to reach out. At this moment in time, I have used my own Github
    to act as the link for the projects and to contact.

    - I believe that my source code is readable. Looking back I wish I would have spent more time with it to make it 
    look better. It was a great learning experience though and will use this project to better future projects.

    - My one animation is a gradient color change of a certain type of text. The name of this function is 
    "text-gradient name-text", which I use as the title for all the pages.

    - My SQL database connection is being used in the form for having people want to contact my client. This information
    is stored in a database for my client to look and sort through.


    2. Critique from Client

    One of the biggest critiques from my client was the lack of accurate information. Obviously this can be
    fixed with getting more information from the client and implementing that into the proper locations in
    the webpages. 

    My client loved the color scheme and the overall flow of the website. My client didn't give me a preferred color
    so this color scheme is one that I choose and I think it turned out very nice. He also said that he liked the 
    way the projects are displayed on the cards, wiht a brief description and image to go along with it. He liked
    that people will be able to read the description, and if they are interested in learning more they can go to the 
    projects full page with more information.


    3. Addressing comments from Project Demonstration

    The first comment I addressed was the button to go to the individual projects page to be styled to fit
    the theme of the site. I completely agreed with this comment and styled it betetr to fit the theme. I also
    ended up moving the location of the button from the far left side, to be centered in the middle of the footer
    on the card.

    Another comment I addressed was the extra white space on the home page. This was due to the height of the page
    being set to 300vh. I did agree, however when I made that change to 200vh, the individual projects pages were negatively
    affected and I wasn't able to fit the styling on all the pages to get rid of the white space and make the project
    pages look good. So unfortunately I do still have some extra white space on the home page. But, with more information
    it will get filled up and look much better. I tested this with dummy information and it worked well.

    Another issue I addressed was the lack of forms on the website. I knew after reading through the guidelines that
    I would immediately add a contact form, however I was not able to complete it before the final presentationd date.
    So that is one of my highest priorities before turning in the final project.

    I believe the last comment made was about the contact us links being located in the footer. I did think that 
    was a good idea during the presentation, but during testing it didn't end up working out with styling issues.
    So I ended up keeping it were it was originally located on the home page. I think that with the addition of the
    contact us form, the links look a lot better with more space taken up next to it.


    4. Which webpages have forms

    The only page that has a form in the home page. That is to allow people to reach out to contact my dad regarding
    site suggestions as well as to reach out about any other matter. I didn't think there would be any other forms
    necessary for a professional website that wouldn't be redundant. 


    5. Group Member Contribution

    I did this project by myself, so I did 100% of the work.



    Other than what is mentioned above, I did not add anything else to the project. The comments that were made were
    exactly what I needed to add / change to wrap up the project as a whole.
